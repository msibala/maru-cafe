# print all the numbers / integers from 0 - 150
print int(0 - 150)

#print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 100,000

#counting, the dojo way 
print integers 1 to 100. if divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. if by 10, also print "Dojo"

#Whoa. That sucker's huge - add odd integers from 0 - 500,000 and print final sum
print odd( 0 - 500,000)
sum odd int( 0 - 500,000)

#countdown by fours - print positive numbers starting at 2018, countdown by fours (exclude 0)


#flexible countdown - based on earlier "coountdown by Fours", 
#give lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from lowNum to highNum, using a FOR lopp. For (2,93) print 3 6 9 (on succesive lines)
